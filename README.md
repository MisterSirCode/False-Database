# Simple False Database (Organized JSON)

    Literally a fake database. I wanted a way to interact with JSON that had type checking / structuring and other nice features builtin to it.

- Only reads / writes during restarts
- THIS IS NOT INTENDED FOR LARGE PROJECTS! 
    - This is just a convenience thing I made for myself.
    - **This is not a true database format. Use SQLite or something instead**
